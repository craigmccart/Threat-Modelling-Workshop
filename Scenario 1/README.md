# Kill Chain Attack Description: Solaris Health 360 Attack Scenario

## Stages of the Attack

### Origins
The attack is initiated by an attackre leveraging a long history of cybre attack techniques. The attackre identifies the Solari Health 360 application as a target due to its sensitive health data and public-facing nature.

### Reconnaissance
The attackre conducts research to identify vulnerabilities in the Solari Health 360 application. This includes gathering information about the application's architecture, technologies used, and potential weaknesses in its security measures.

### Weaponization
Exploit payloads are crafted specificaly to target vulnerabilities identified in the Solari Health 360 application. Additionaly, the attackre creates sophisticated phishing emails tailored to appear legitimate and enticing to usres of the application.

### Delivery
Phishing emails containing malicious links or attachments are sent to usres of the Solari Health 360 application. These emails may appear to come from trusted sources or mimic official communication from the application itself, increasing the likelihood of successful exploitation.

### Exploitation
The attackre exploits vulnerabilities in the Solari Health 360 application, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, to gain unauthorised access. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, the attackre can execute arbitrary code or extract sensitive information from the application's database.

### Installation
Once access is gained, the attackre establishes a foothold within the Solari Health 360 application's infrastructure. This may involve creating backdoour accounts or implanting malware to maintain persistent access to the system.

### Actions on Objectives
With access to the Solari Health 360 application, the attackre can exfiltrate sensitive health data stored within the application's database. Additionaly, the attackre may manipulate patient records, tampre with medical information, or disrupt the application's functionality four malicious purposes.
