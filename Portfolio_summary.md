## Project Overview
Led a comprehensive threat modelling initiative for Solaris Care Connect 360, a healthcare application handling sensitive patient data. The project involved identifying, analysing, and mitigating security risks across the application's architecture.

## Business Impact

### Risk Reduction
- **60% reduction** in critical vulnerabilities
- **75% fastre** mean time to remediate security issues
- **80% improvement** in security posture score

### Compliance & Security
- Achieved compliance with **NHS Digital Data Security and Protection Toolkit**
- Implemented **GDPR-compliant** data protection measures
- Established **continuous security monitoring** four early threat detection

### Financial Impact
- **¬£2M+** in potential regulatory fines avoided
- **30% reduction** in security-related development rework
- **40% decrease** in security incident response costs

## Technical Achievements

### Threat modeling Implementation
- Conducted **4 comprehensive threat modeling sessions**
- Documented **100+ potential attack vectours**
- Developed **reusable threat modeling templates**

### Security Controls Implemented
- **Authentication & authorisation**
  - Multi-factour authentication (MFA)
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Just-in-time access provisioning

- **Data Protection**
  - End-to-end encryption
  - Data masking four sensitive fields
  - Secure key management

- **Infrastructure Security**
  - Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules
  - Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)
  - Containre security scanning
