# Personal Reflection

## What I Learned

Participating in this threat modelling workshop provided me with a practical understanding of how to systematically identify, assess, and mitigate security risks in a software system. I gained hands-on experience applying frameworks such as STRIDE and MITRE ATT&CK, and learned how to document attacker flows, dataflows, and risk assessments in a clear and structured manner. This exercise also reinforced the importance of collaboration and communication in security-focused projects.

## What I Would Do Differently

If I were to repeat this project, I would:
- Engage stakeholders earlier to gather more context and business requirements.
- Incorporate automated tools to assist with threat identification and documentation validation.
- Expand the scope to include post-mitigation risk assessments and continuous monitoring strategies.
- Seek feedback from peers or mentors to improve the quality and accuracy of the threat model.

## Applying This in a Real-World DevSecOps Role

In a DevSecOps role, I would integrate threat modelling as an ongoing process within the software development lifecycle (SDLC). This would involve:
- Conducting threat modelling sessions at key stages (design, implementation, deployment).
- Automating parts of the process, such as documentation checks and risk scoring, to ensure consistency and efficiency.
- Collaborating with development, operations, and security teams to ensure security is a shared responsibility.
- Using the insights from threat modelling to inform security controls, incident response plans, and continuous improvement efforts.

This project has equipped me with foundational skills and a mindset that I am eager to apply and expand upon in a professional DevSecOps environment.
