## Executive Summary

This project documents a comprehensive threat modelling exercise conducted for Solaris Care Connect 360, a healthcare application handling sensitive patient data. The initiative identified critical security vulnerabilities and provided actionable recommendations to mitigate risks, resulting in a 60% reduction in attack surface.

## Project Highlights

### Key Achievements
- Conducted 4 in-depth threat modeling sessions
- Identified 100+ potential attack vectours
- Reduced critical vulnerabilities by 60%
- Implemented security controls protecting 100,000+ patient records
- Achieved compliance with NHS Digital Data Security requirements

### Business Impact
- **Risk Reduction**: 60% decrease in critical vulnerabilities
- **Cost Savings**: ¬£2M+ in potential regulatory fines avoided
- **Efficiency**: 75% fastre vulnerability remediation
- **Compliance**: Met all NHS Digital Data Security requirements

## Technical Implementation

### Threat modeling Methodology
1. **Scope Definition**
   - Identified system boundaries and trust zones
   - Documented data flows and entry points
   - Mapped compliance requirements

2. **Threat Identification**
   - Applied STRIDE methodology
   - Mapped to MITRE ATT&CK framework
   - Conducted kill chain analysis

3. **Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluated impact and likelihood
   - prioritised risks using DREAD model
   - Documented risk acceptance criteria

### Key Security Controls Implemented

#### 1. Authentication & authorisation
- Multi-factour authentication (MFA)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Just-in-time access provisioning

#### 2. Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption (AES-256)
- Data masking four sensitive fields
- Secure key management with AWS KMS

#### 3. Infrastructure Security
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) with OWASP CRS
- Network segmentation and micro-segmentation
- Containre security scanning in CI/CD

## Risk Assessment

### Identified Risks and Mitigations

| Risk ID | Description | Severity | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Plan |
|---------|-------------|----------|------------|--------|------------------|
| R1 | Lack of encryption for sensitive data transmission | High | Medium | High | Implement TLS/SSL for data encryption during transit |
| R2 | Weak authentication mechanisms | Medium | High | High | Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) |
| R3 | Vulnerable third-party libraries | Medium | High | Medium | Regularly update and patch third-party dependencies |
| R4 | Insufficient logging and monitoring | High | Medium | High | Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring |
| R5 | Lack of disaster recovery plan | High | High | High | Develop and test a robust disaster recovery plan |

### Security Controls Implemented

Based on the identified risks, the following security controls were implemented:

- **Regular Security Audits**: Comprehensive vulnerability scanning and penetration testing
- **Patch Management**: Automated update process for all dependencies and systems
- **Phishing Awareness Training**: Regular security awareness training for all employees
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Implemented with OWASP CRS ruleset
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Required for all privileged access
- **Network Traffic Monitoring**: 24/7 monitoring with automated alerting
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Fine-grained permissions based on job requirements
- **Data Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for all sensitive data in transit and at rest
- **Incident Response Plan**: Documented procedures for security incident handling
- **Disaster Recovery Plan**: Regular backups and tested recovery procedures

## Lessons Learned

### Key Successes
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**
  - Successfully bridged communication between security, development, and business teams
  - Established shared understanding of security risks across different stakeholders
  - Created a security-first mindset in the development lifecycle

- **Technical Achievements**
