# DevSecOps Best Practices: Integrating Threat Modelling

## Integrating Threat Modelling into CI/CD

1. **Shift Left Security**: Incorporate threat modelling early in the SDLC, ideally during the design and planning phases.
2. **Automated Checks**: Use CI/CD pipelines to automate checks for security requirements, threat model updates, and documentation completeness.
3. **Continuous Feedback**: Ensure that threat models are living documents, updated as code and architecture evolve. Integrate feedback loops from code reviews and security testing.
4. **Collaboration**: Foster collaboration between developers, security engineers, and operations teams to ensure shared responsibility for security.
5. **Security Gates**: Implement security gates in the pipeline that require threat model sign-off before progressing to production.

## Automating Threat Modelling Processes

- **Documentation Validation**: Use scripts or CI jobs to check that all required sections (e.g., attacker flows, dataflow diagrams, risk assessments) are present and up-to-date.
- **Risk Scoring Automation**: Integrate tools that can automatically score risks based on predefined criteria, helping prioritize mitigation efforts.
- **Template Enforcement**: Use markdown templates and linters to ensure consistency and completeness across threat model documents.
- **Integration with Issue Trackers**: Link identified threats and mitigations to tickets in issue tracking systems (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues) for better visibility and accountability.

## Example CI/CD Workflow

1. Developer submits a pull request with code and updated threat model documentation.
2. CI pipeline runs:
   - Linting and validation scripts for markdown files.
   - Automated security scans (SAST, DAST, dependency checks).
   - Checks for required threat model updates.
3. Security gate ensures all checks pass before merging.
4. Continuous monitoring and feedback after deployment.

By embedding threat modelling into CI/CD, organizations can proactively identify and address security risks, making security an integral part of the development process.
